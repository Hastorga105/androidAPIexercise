<h2>Quick Overview</h2>
A practice application to retrieve data from an API in an android app. Created using Kotiln (Android Studio) and JetPack Compose.
<br> <h2>About this project</h2>
This project was part of a Mobile Development class, I was tasked with creating an application where I could see data from an API. In this project I made use of the MVVM architecture, Hilt, dependency inyection and Retrofit.
<br>I used Google's Firebase to store the information from a JSON file in an API.

<br>For the design I used Android's Jetpack Compose.
